# Description

This is a React, NestJS dockerized web application for managing cars (CRUD operations) using PostgreSQL and TypeORM.


# Installation guide

Starting the program in a Docker environment: a Docker runtime environment (e.g. Docker Desktop) is required. We can install the environment in the root folder with a docker compose up --build command.

For local development, you can use cd client && npm start, cd server && npm start and install a Postgres database before all of this.
